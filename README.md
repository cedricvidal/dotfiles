CÃ©dric's Dotfiles
=================

Inspired by [@dgageot 's dotfiles](https://github.com/dgageot/dotfiles) but replaced ~/.bash_profile handling with a [slightly forked bash-it](https://github.com/cedricvidal/bash-it), handling other dot files with [fresh](http://freshshell.com/) and focusing on brew and node.

Installation
------------

```
git clone git@github.com:cedricvidal/dotfiles.git ~/.dotfiles
~/.dotfiles/install
```
