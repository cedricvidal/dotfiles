# Add User OSX Command Line
# =========================

# An easy add user script for Max OSX.
# Although I wrote this for 10.7 Lion Server, these commands have been the same since 10.5 Leopard.
# It's pretty simple as it uses and strings together the (rustic and ancient) commands that OSX 
# already uses to add users.

# === Typically, this is all the info you need to enter ===

read USERNAME

# A list of (secondary) groups the user should belong to
# This makes the difference between admin and non-admin users.
